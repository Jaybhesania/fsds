    "**1.** Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Functions are advantageous to have in your programs because they allow you to break your code into smaller, reusable parts that can be called as needed. This makes your code more modular, easier to read, and easier to maintain.\n",
